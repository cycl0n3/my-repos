The prior probabilities for events A1 and A2 are P(A1) = .40 and P(A2) + .60. It is also
known that P(A1 ^ A2) = 0. Suppose P(B | A1) = .20 and P(B | A2) = .05.
a. Are A1 and A2 mutually exclusive? Explain.
b. Compute P(A1 ^ B) and P(A2 ^ B).
c. Compute P(B).
d. Apply Bayesâ€™ theorem to compute P(A1 | B) and P(A2 | B).
